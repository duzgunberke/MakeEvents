# MakeEvents

Organize and sell tickets with your friends, business or small community. You have friends who play beautiful drums and electro, and he wants to throw a solo party in his villa. Or you will go to sit with the people around you. Manage attended university or company events from one place by filling out a Google form. Do you have a small cafe and have a karaoke night at night? An app where you can do all this and more. You can either make purchases for the party in your villa or the karaoke night in your cafe by creating a paid ticket, or you can organize with a smaller group who will come to sit on the beach in the evening with the participation requests they send. View open events near you on the map, buy tickets or send an invitation to attend. View other attendees on your way to the university party and send the invite link to the person you want to invite.

## Goal
The aim at the end of the project is to reach events that big giants such as Biletix and Passo could not reach. Everyone can see the big concerts in the VW arena at Dorock XL, and if a smaller club does not inform about the event organized by the cafe that night on their Instagram account, there is no application that they can deliver. Or you are organizing an event with a group of 10-15 people and you want to make it open to the outside. In such cases, we will assist users where we can advertise the event and simply approve their invitation to participate if we wish, by ticketing them.
You can see the event organized by Hayalkahvesi or any organizer, but where is the best ticket? Instead of getting lost on Biletix, passo, Biletinial... sites, find the most suitable ticket on the internet among events such as Cimri.com or akak√ße.
